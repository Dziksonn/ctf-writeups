Hello! [GameHacking.gg](https://gamehacking.gg) CTF was really fun with a lot of interesting challenges. I managed to solve some of them and here are my writeups for them. It was my first real CTF and I'm really happy with the results. I ended up on i think 6th place. (Still waiting for final scores). All feedback appreciated, both negative and positive!
