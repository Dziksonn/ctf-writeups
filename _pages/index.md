Hello, I'm Dziks0nn. Backend Dev from Poland. Always was very curious how things are cracked and hacked. So I started to learn about Reverse Engineering and Cyber Security just as hobby. Don't expect quality stuff here. Here are some of my writeups from CTFs and other challenges. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me on [Discord](discord://-/users/475452946037866508) (in case link doesnt work my nickname is: dziks0nn).
